Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of york.
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house in the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths our bruised arms hung up for monuments.
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
Grim visaged war hath smooth his wrinkled front.
And now instead of mounting barded steeds.
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber.
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
But I that am not shaped for sportive tricks
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass
I that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph.
I that am curtail'd of this fair proportion.
